// TASK: Declare 3 variables with explicit types:
// - a number called `age`
// - a string called `firstName`
// - a boolean called `isEnrolled`

// Then, assign values to each of them.

// BONUS: Try declaring a variable without an explicit type and see what type is inferred!

// Your code here ðŸ‘‡

let age: number;
let firstName: string;
let isEnrolled: boolean;

age = 31;
firstName = "Shantel";
isEnrolled = true;
