// TASK: Declare 3 variables with explicit types:
// - a number called `age`
// - a string called `firstName`
// - a boolean called `isEnrolled`

// Then, assign values to each of them.

// BONUS: Try declaring a variable without an explicit type and see what type is inferred!

// Your code here ðŸ‘‡
const age: number = 5

let firstName: string = 'hey'

let isEnrolled: boolean = true
